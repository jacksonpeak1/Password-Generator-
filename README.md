## Description
This homework assignment challenged me when implementing Javascript into writing code. For completing this homework assignment, i first created strings containing all the different letter, number, and special character choices that a user could select when creating their password. I used a variety of Javascript functions for this project including the function generatePassword. I also created a new variable called passLength, and with that variable I used the Javascript function of alert to send the user alert messages while generating their new password. These alerts included if the number was too low or too high. I also used the prompt message to ask the user how many characters they want in their new password. Additionally i used the confirm method to help the user confirm each of their choices when generating the new password, including confirming if the user: wanted uppercase or lowercase letters in their password; whether the user wanted numbers in their password; and whether the user wanted special characters in their password. Overall I really enjoyed this project, and I look forward to practicing and perfecting Javascript more  in the future.
